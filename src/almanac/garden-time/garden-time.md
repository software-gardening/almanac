The software garden is intertwined in a story of time which is exhibited like a shadow on a moss-covered sundial.
Time is observed indirectly through a kind of software archeology in past-tense material artifacts (files) and present-tense operation (procedures).
As with many things, the future is elusive for software; we grow software systems slowly and often in unrpedicable patterns, like the rings of a tree.

These software tree rings are vessels of temporal data which offer a unique insight into growth patterns.
We can study these patterns like dendronchronology: "Peel away the hard, rough bark and there is a living document, history recorded in rings of wood cells." {cite:p}`gramling2020tree`
This helps us measure the temporary nature of software and how it evolves.

All code in a file as past tense representation, shadows of the process

Dendrochronology, tree rings as exhibiting patterns we didn't know existed otherwise

Backcasting

Pulsing of time

"The sociologist Elise Boulding diagnosed the problem of our times as “temporal exhaustion”: “If one is mentally out of breath all the time from dealing with the present, there is no energy left for imaging the future."
- Stewart Brand, The Clock Of The Long Now: Time and Responsibility

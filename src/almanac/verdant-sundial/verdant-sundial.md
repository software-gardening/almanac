The software garden is intertwined in a story of time which is exhibited like a shadow on a moss-covered sundial.
Time is observed indirectly through a kind of software archeology in past-tense material artifacts (files) and present-tense operation (procedures).
These artifacts act as shadows of our prior creative intentions where procedures become the living present materialized promise of those intentions.
"This brings an uncanny sense of living in a state where the future is a dimension of our present reality." {cite:p}`morton2013hyperobjects`
The future is elusive but present in software artifacts, similar to rings of a tree that depict the hope of change.

These software tree rings are vessels of temporal data which offer a unique insight into growth patterns.
We can study these patterns like dendronchronology: "Peel away the hard, rough bark and there is a living document, history recorded in rings of wood cells." {cite:p}`gramling2020tree`
This helps us understand the chronological nature of software and how it evolves.
It also shares patterns of temporal pulsing - not all times of the software garden are the same.

These software pulses give us with visibility into distinct growing or receding patterns.
Some code exhibits annual behavior, requiring continual replanting efforts each season.
Others are perennials, undergoing seasonal change perpetuated by periods of vibrancy and dormancy.
Seasons of software promote differing patterns among these; some systems prepare for winter through conservation only to fervently bloom during their spring.

Seasonal chronology in software benefits also from an awareness of kairos, the opportune timing of our actions amidst time.
Each software gardening moment includes a series of options of varying kairological fitness.
As we gain experience in software gardens we begin to anticipate seasonal change which helps us project preparatory change.
This forecasting turns into wisdom as we contemplate: how do we build software which lasts 100 years or more?
